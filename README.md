This is a very simple NodeJs presentation I created for a lightnight talk at work.

The project uses NodeJs to save slide contents to a Mongo database, then display the slides in the browser using some pretty CSS.  You can even view the application source code by going to http://localhost:3000/app.js

Requirements:
  - NodeJs
  - MongoDb

To Run:
  - "node app.js"
  - go to http://localhost:3000
  - type in some slide titles and contents
  - click through the slides
  - talk about interesting stuff, so people will listen
