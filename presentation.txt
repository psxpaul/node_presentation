Introduction
-Node.js is Javascript on the backend!
-uses a dynamic language on a very fast VM (V8)
-event driven programming model, processing things in a single process


Why Node.js
-Browser wars -> lots of money invested in Javascript implementations -> V8 is incredibly fast
-everyone (hopefully) knows Javascript here
-the Node.js community is very active
-using the same language on the frontend and the backend has advantages (e.g. code reuse, context switching, native JSON manipulation, etc.)
-Javascript is fun
